# R2D2 Diorama

These are the files used to control the audio/lighting circuit I will use on my Bandai 1/12 R2D2 Diorama. Check out my homepage/blog for more details, I will be posting there along the way as well	. 

Disclaimer: 
I am NOT a professional programmer. There WILL be bugs and weird mistakes. I try to remove them when I find them, but I cannot guarantee that all my solutions used in the code are good/best practice. Also, I am pretty sure this won't destroy your hardware if you try it for yourself, but obviously I take no responsibility if you decide to use my code.. 

You have been warned :) 

Also, feel free to copy/modify and use this piece of code if you find it useful. As thanks you could always follow my blog (https://oleandre.net) and/or Instagram @oleshobbyblog (https://www.instagram.com/oleshobbyblog/) and/or YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/vaipernor).
